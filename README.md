# Distant Object Detection

Devised a method to detect a person standing very far for intelligent railway
systems surveillance. Used modified hough transformation algorithms for
railway track detection, HSV segmentation to denoise the images and the
modified Faster RCNN method by setting the appropriate anchor size at the
RCNN pipeline. Implemented upsampling of the image at the RPN funnel of
RCNN so that the magnified image is processed further layers of the network
